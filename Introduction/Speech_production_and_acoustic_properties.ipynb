    "## Physiological speech production\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "When a person has the urge or intention to speak, her or his brain forms\n",
    "a sentence with the intended meaning and maps the sequence of words into\n",
    "physiological movements required to produce the corresponding sequence\n",
    "of speech sounds. The neural part of speech production is not discussed\n",
    "further here.\n",
    "\n",
    "The physical activity begins by contracting the lungs, pushing out air\n",
    "from the lungs, through the throat, oral and nasal cavities. Airflow in\n",
    "itself is not audible as a sound - sound is an oscillation in air\n",
    "pressure. To obtain a sound, we therefore need to obstruct airflow to\n",
    "obtain an oscillation or turbulence. Oscillations are primarily produced\n",
    "when the [*vocal folds*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocal_cords) are\n",
    "tensioned appropriately. This produces *voiced sounds* and is perhaps\n",
    "the most characteristic property of speech signals. Oscillations can\n",
    "also be produced by other parts of the speech production organs, such as\n",
    "letting the tongue oscillate against the teeth in a rolling /r/, or by\n",
    "letting the uvula oscillate in the airflow, known as the uvular trill\n",
    "(viz. something like a guttural /r/). Such trills, both with the tongue\n",
    "and the uvula, should however not be confused with voiced sounds, which\n",
    "are always generated by oscillations in the vocal folds. Sounds without\n",
    "oscillations in the vocal folds are known as *unvoiced sounds.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Most typical unvoiced sounds are caused by turbulences produced by\n",
    "static constrictions of airflow in any part of the air spaces above the\n",
    "vocal folds (viz. larynx, pharynx and oral or nasal cavities). For\n",
    "example, by letting the tongue rest close to the teeth, we obtain the\n",
    "consonant /s/, and by stopping and releasing airflow by closing and\n",
    "opening the lips, we obtain the consonant /p/. A further particular\n",
    "class of phonemes are nasal consonants, where airflow through the mouth\n",
    "is stopped entirely or partially, such that a majority of the air flows\n",
    "through the nose.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The vocal folds\n",
    "\n",
    "The *vocal folds,* also known as vocal cords, are located in the throat\n",
    "and oscillate to produce voiced sounds. The opening between the vocal\n",
    "folds (the empty space between the vocal folds) is known as the\n",
    "*glottis*. Correspondingly, the airspace between the vocal folds and the\n",
    "lungs is known as the *subglottal* area.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the pressure below the glottis, known as the *subglottal pressure*\n",
    "increases, it pushes open the vocal folds. When open, air rushes through\n",
    "the vocal folds. The return movement, again closing the vocal folds is\n",
    "mainly caused by the [Venturi\n",
    "effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venturi_effect), which causes a\n",
    "drop in air pressure between the vocal folds when air is flowing through\n",
    "them. As the vocal folds are closing, they will eventually clash\n",
    "together. This sudden stop of airflow is the largest acoustic event in\n",
    "the vocal folds and is known as the *glottal excitation*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of airflow, the effect is that during the *closed phase* (when\n",
    "the vocal folds are closed), there is no airflow. At the beginning of\n",
    "the *open phase* (when the vocal fold are open), air starts to flow\n",
    "through the glottis and obviously, with the closing of the vocal folds\n",
    "also air flow is decreasing. However, due to the momentum of air itself,\n",
    "the movement of air occurs slightly after the vocal folds. In other\n",
    "words, there is a phase-difference between vocal folds movement and\n",
    "glottal airflow waveform.\n",
    "\n",
    "The frequency of vocal folds oscillation is dependent on three main\n",
    "components; amount of lengthwise tension in the vocal folds, pressure\n",
    "differential above and below the vocal folds, as well as length and mass\n",
    "of the vocal folds. Pressure and tension can be intentionally changed to\n",
    "cause a change in frequency. The length and mass of the vocal folds are\n",
    "in turn correlated with overall body size of the speaker, which explains\n",
    "the fact that children and females have on average a higher pitch than\n",
    "male speakers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the frequency of the vocal folds refers to the actual physical\n",
    "phenomenon, whereas *pitch* refers to the perception of frequency. There\n",
    "are many cases where these two may differ, for example, resonances in\n",
    "the vocal tract can emphasise harmonics of the fundamental frequency\n",
    "such that the harmonics are louder than the fundamental, and such that\n",
    "we perceive one of the harmonics as the fundamental. The perceived pitch\n",
    "is then the frequency of the harmonic instead of the fundamental.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The vocal tract\n",
    "\n",
    "The vocal tract, including the larynx, pharynx and oral cavities, have a\n",
    "great effect on the timbre of the sound. Namely, the shape of the vocal\n",
    "tract determines the resonances and anti-resonances of the acoustic\n",
    "space, which boost and attenuate different frequencies of the sound. The\n",
    "shape is determined by a multitude of components, in particular by the\n",
    "position of the jaw, lips and tongue. The resonances are easily modified\n",
    "by the speaker and perceived by the listener, and they can thus be used\n",
    "in communication to convey information. Specifically, the acoustic\n",
    "features which differentiate *vowels* from each other are the\n",
    "frequencies of the resonances in the vocal tract, corresponding to\n",
    "specific *places* of articulation primarily in terms of tongue position.\n",
    "Since the air can flow relatively unobstructed, vowel sounds tend to\n",
    "have high energy and loudness compared to *consonants*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In *consonant* sounds, there is a partial or full obstruction at some\n",
    "part of the vocal tract. For instance, *fricative consonants* are\n",
    "characterized by a narrow gap between the tongue and front/top of the\n",
    "mouth, leading to hiss-like turbulent air flow. In plosives, the airflow\n",
    "in the vocal tract is fully temporarily obstructed. As an example,\n",
    "*bilabial plosives* are characterized by temporary closure of the lips,\n",
    "which leads to accumulation of air pressure in the vocal tract due to\n",
    "sustained lung pressure. When the lips are opened, the accumulated air\n",
    "is released together with a short *burst* sound (plosion) that has\n",
    "impulse- and noise-like characteristics. Similarly to vowels, the\n",
    "*place* of the obstruction in the mouth (i.e., place of articulation)\n",
    "will affect the acoustic characteristics of the consonant sound by\n",
    "modifying the acoustic characteristics of the vocal tract. In addition,\n",
    "*manner* of articulation is used to characterize different consonant\n",
    "sounds, as there are several ways to produce speech while the position\n",
    "of the primary obstruction can remain the same (e.g., short *taps* and\n",
    "*flaps*, repeated *trills,* or already mentioned narrow constrictions\n",
    "for *fricatives*).\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of vocal tract shape, a special class of consonants are the\n",
    "*nasals*, which are produced with velum (a soft structure at the back\n",
    "top of the oral cavity) open, thereby allowing air to flow to the *nasal\n",
    "cavity*. When the velum is open, the vocal tract can be viewed as a\n",
    "shared tube from the larynx to the back of the mouth, after which the\n",
    "tract is divided into two parallel branches consisting of the oral and\n",
    "nasal cavities. Coupling of the nasal cavity to the vocal tract has a\n",
    "pronounced impact on the resonances and anti-resonance of the tract.\n",
    "This is commonly perceived as *nasalization* of speech sounds by\n",
    "listeners. \n",

    "## Acoustic properties of speech signals\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important acoustic features of a speech signal are (roughly\n",
    "speaking)\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The *resonance of the vocal tract*, especially the two lowest\n",
    "    resonances, known as the *formants* F1 and F2 (see figure below). The resonance structure can be easily examined by drawing an\n",
    "    \"*envelope\"* above the spectrum, that is, to draw a smooth line\n",
    "    which goes just above the spectrum, as seen on the figure below. We thus obtain the *spectral envelope*, which characterizes\n",
    "    the macro-shape of the spectrum of a speech signal, and which is\n",
    "    often used to model speech signals.\n",
    "-   The *fundamental frequency* of a speech signal or its absence\n",
    "    carries a lot of information. Per definition, voiced and unvoiced\n",
    "    phonemes, respectively, are those with or without an oscillation in\n",
    "    the vocal folds. Due to its prominence, we categorize phonemes\n",
    "    according to whether they are voiced or unvoiced.  \n",
    "    The airflow which passes through the oscillating vocal folds will\n",
    "    generally have a waveform which resembles a [half-wave rectified\n",
    "    sinusoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectifier#Half-wave_rectification).\n",
    "    That is, airflow is zero when the vocal folds are closed (closed\n",
    "    phase) and during the open time (open phase) the waveform resembles\n",
    "    (somewhat) the shape of the upper part of a sinusoid. The spectrum\n",
    "    of this waveform will therefore have the structure of a harmonic\n",
    "    signal, that is, the spectrum will have peaks at the fundamental\n",
    "    frequency and its integer multiples (see figure below).  \n",
    "    In most languages, pitch does not differentiate between phonemes.\n",
    "    However, in languages that are known as *tonal* languages, the shape\n",
    "    of the pitch contour over time does bear semantic meaning (see\n",

    "    (linguistics)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tone_(linguistics)) for\n",
    "    a nice sound sample). Pitch contours are however often used to\n",

    "\n",
    "### Vocal tract\n",
    "\n",
    "Vowels are central to spoken communication, and vowels are determined by\n",
    "the shape of the vocal tract. Modelling the vocal tract is therefore of\n",
    "particular interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Simple models\n",
    "\n",
    "The vocal tract is essentially a tube of varying length. It has a\n",
    "90-degree bend, where the throat turns into the mouth, but the acoustic\n",
    "effect of that bend is minor and can be ignored in simple models. The\n",
    "tube has two pathways, through the oral and nasal cavities. The acoustic\n",
    "effect of the oral cavity dominates the output signal such that, roughly\n",
    "speaking, the oral cavity generates resonances to the output sound,\n",
    "while the nasal cavities contributes mainly anti-resonances (dips or\n",
    "valleys) to the spectral envelope. Presence of energy is perceptually\n",
    "more important than absence of energy and anti-resonances can therefore\n",
    "be ignored in simple models.\n",
    "\n",
    "A very simple model is thus a straight cylindrical tube sub-divided into\n",
    "constant radius segments of equal length (see illustration below). If we further assume that the tube-segments are lossless, then\n",
    "this tube is analytically equivalent with a [linear\n",
    "predictor](content:linearprediction). This is a fantastic simplification in the\n",
    "sense that from a physiologically motivated model we obtain a\n",
    "analytically reasonable model whose parameters we can readily estimate\n",
    "from observed signals. In fact, the temporal correlation of speech\n",
    "signals can be very efficiently modelled with linear predictors. It\n",
    "offers a very attractive connection between physiological and signal\n",
    "modelling. Unfortunately, it is not entirely accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though speech signals are very efficiently modelled by linear\n",
    "predictors, and linear predictors are analytically equivalent with\n",
    "tube-models, *linear predictors estimated from sound signals need not\n",
    "correspond to the tube which generated the sound*. The mismatch in the\n",
    "shape of estimated and real tubes is due to two primary reasons;\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Estimation of linear predictive coefficients assumes that the\n",
    "    excitation, viz. the glottal excitation, is uncorrelated (white\n",
    "    noise). This is certainly an incorrect assumption. Though the\n",
    "    periodic structure of the glottal excitation does not much bias\n",
    "    linear predictors, glottal excitations are also dominated by\n",
    "    low-frequency components which will bias the linear predictor. The\n",
    "    linear predictor cannot make a distinction between features of the\n",
    "    glottal excitation and contributions of the vocal tract, but model\n",
    "    both indiscriminately. We also do not know the precise contribution\n",
    "    of the glottal excitation such that it is hard to compensate for it.\n",
    "2.  The analytical relationship between coefficients of the linear\n",
    "    predictor and the radii of the tube-model segments is highly\n",
    "    non-linear and sensitive to estimation errors. Small errors in\n",
    "    predictor parameters can have large consequences in the shape of the\n",
    "    tube model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Still, since linear predictors are efficient for modelling speech, they\n",
    "are useful in speech modelling even if the connection to tube-modelling\n",
    "is sensitive to errors. Linear prediction is particularly attractive\n",
    "because it gives computationally efficient algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advanced models\n",
    "\n",
    "When more accurate modelling of the vocal tract is required, we have to\n",
    "re-evaluate our assumptions. With [digital\n",
    "waveguides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_waveguide_synthesis)\n",
    "we can readily formulate models which incorporate a second pathway\n",
    "corresponding to the nasal tract. A starting point for such models is\n",
    "linear prediction, written as a delay-line with reflections\n",
    "corresponding to the interfaces between tube-segments. The nasal tract\n",
    "can then be introduced by adding a second delay line. Such models are\n",
    "computationally efficient in synthesis of sounds, but estimating their\n",
    "parameters from real sounds can be difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stepping up the accuracy, we then already go into full-blown physical\n",
    "modelling such as [finite-element\n",
    "methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_element_method) (FEM).\n",
    "Here, for example, the air-volume of the vocal tract can be split into\n",
    "small interacting elements governed by [fluid\n",

    "the mesh of the elements is, the more accurately the model corresponds\n",
    "to physical reality. Measuring and modelling the vocal tract with this\n",
