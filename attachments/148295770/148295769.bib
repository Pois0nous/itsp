  abstract = {Speech and audio coding have during the last decade converged to an
	increasingly unified technology. This contribution discusses one
	of the remaining fundamental differences between speech and audio
	paradigms, namely, windowing of the input signal. Audio codecs generally
	use lapped transforms and apply a perceptual model in the transform
	domain, whereby temporal continuity is achieved by windowing and
	overlap-add. Speech codecs on the other hand achieve temporal continuity
	by using linear predictive filtering, whereby windowing is applied
	in the residual domain. Despite these fundamental differences, we
	demonstrate that the two windowing approaches, combined with perceptual
	modeling, perform very similarly both in terms of perceptual quality
	and theoretical properties.},
