This is a collection of pedagogical material within the topic of speech
and language technology. The idea is to provide

-   teachers material for their courses, where they can pick and choose
    material which is appropriate for their own courses.
-   self-study material on-line for anyone interested.

By licensing the material under creative commons (share alike), we want
to encourage people to contribute improvements and additions to the
content.

## Design philosophy of this document

-   Target audience
    -   Primary target:
        -   Master's level students with some background in digital
            signal processing (=signals and systems), machine learning,
            linear algebra and stochastic processes
    -   Secondary targets:
        -   Researchers in related areas who want to expand their
            expertise, for example, researchers in machine learning,
            signal processing, audio processing, linguistics,
            human-computer interfaces etc
-   Keep a pedagogical approach
    -   Explain why this tool is needed and how it solves a problem.
    -   Give an example of how it is used in practice, including
        demonstrations and pictures.
    -   Favour tools which everyone are using, rather than inventions of
        your own team
-   Small steps
    -   Better to have something than nothing. Though it is a good
        direction, reaching perfection is not a requirement.
    -   Fix errors immediately when you find one.
