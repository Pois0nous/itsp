    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is a mathematical model that tries to simulate the structure and functionalities of biological neural networks. Basic building block of every artificial neural network is artificial neuron, that is, a simple mathematical model\n",
    "(function).  Artificial neuron is a basic building block of every\n",
    "artificial neural network. Its design and functionalities are derived from observation of a biological neuron that is basic building block of biological neural networks (systems) which includes the brain, spinal\n",
    "cord and peripheral ganglia. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Computational modelling using neural networks was started in the 1940's\n",
    "and has gone through several waves of innovation and subsequent decline.\n",
    "The recent boom of deep neural networks (DNNs) - which roughly means\n",
    "that the network has more layers of non-linearities than previous\n",
    "models - happened probably due to the increase in available\n",
    "computational power and availability of large data-sets. It has fuelled\n",
    "a flurry of incremental innovation in all directions, and in many\n",
    "modelling tasks, deep neural networks currently give much better results\n",
    "than any competing method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite its successes, application of DNNs in speech processing does not\n",
    "come without its fair share of problems. For example,\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Training DNNs for a specific task on a particular set of data often\n",
    "    does not increase our understanding of the problem. It is a black\n",
    "    box. How are we to know whether the model is reliable? A trained\n",
    "    speech recognizer on a language A does not teach much about speech\n",
    "    recognition for language B (though the process of designing a\n",
    "    recognizers does teach us about languages).\n",
    "-   Training of DNNs is sensitive to the data on which it is trained on.\n",
    "    Models can for example be susceptible to hidden biases, such that\n",
    "    performance degrades for particular under-represented groups of\n",
    "    people.\n",
    "-   A trained DNN is \"a solution\" to a particular problem, but it does\n",
    "    not directly give us information about how good of a solution it is.\n",
    "    For example, if a data-set represents a circle in the 2D-plane, then\n",
    "    it is possible to accurately model that data-set with a neural\n",
    "    network where the non-linearities are sigmoids. The neural network\n",
    "    just has to be large enough and it can do the job. However, the\n",
    "    network is then several orders of magnitude more complex than the\n",
    "    equation of the circle. That is, though training of the network was\n",
    "    successful, and the model is relatively accurate, it gives no\n",
    "    indication if the complexity of the network is of similar scale as\n",
    "    the complexity of the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "To combat such problems, a recent trend in model design has been to\n",
    "return to classical design paradigms, where models are based on thorough\n",
    "understanding of the problem. The parameters of such models are then\n",
    "trained using methods from machine learning."

    "Neurons: It forms the basic structure of a neural network. When we get\n",
    "the information, we process it and then we generate an output.\n",

    "output which is either sent to other neurons for further processing or\n",

    "\n",
    "Weights: When an input enters a neuron, it is multiplied by a weight.\n",
    "Initially, the weights are initialized and they are updated during the\n",

    "as compared to the ones which are considered less important. \n",
    "\n",
    "  \n",

    "Bias: In addition to the weights, another linear component is applied to\n",
    "the input, called as the bias. It is added to the result of weight\n",
    "multiplication to the input. The bias is basically added to change the\n",
    "range of the weight multiplied input."

    "\n",
    "RNNs are very hard to train. Let us see the reason. The term  $ \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial h^l} $ used in backpropagation algorithm is a\n",
