<p>In short, the aim of speech coding methods is primarily to enable
natural and efficient spoken communication over a geographical distance,
given constraints on available resources. In other words, we want to be
able to talk with a distant person with the aid of technology. Usually
distance refers to location, but speech coding can be (and is often)
used for storing speech signals (such that distance refers to distance
in <em>time</em>).</p>
<p>In particular, aspects of quality which we can be included in our design
goals are for example:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><em>Acoustic quality</em> in the sense that the the reproduced acoustical
signal should be similar to the original signal (measured for
example in terms of signal to noise ratio or a perceptually weighted
variant thereof).</p></li>
<li><p><em>Perceptual transparency</em> refers to a property of high-accuracy
coding systems, where a human listener cannot perceive a difference
between the original and reconstructed signals. When discussing
transparency, we however need to accurately define the methodology
with which we measure transparency. Namely, if we compare small
segments of an original and reconstructed signals, we can easily
hear minute differences, which would never be perceived in a
realistic use-case.</p></li>
<li><p>*Intelligibility *such that a listener can interpret the linguistic
meaning of the reproduced signal.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Delay</em> in the communication path, end-to-end, should be within
reasonable limits (e.g. below 150 ms). A higher delay can impede the
naturalness of a dialogue.</p></li>
<li><p>*Noisyness *caused by low-accuracy quantization and background
noises should be minimized.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Distortions</em> of the speech signal to the amount the original signal
is perceived to be changed by the processing.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Naturalness</em> of the speech signal refers to high natural vs.
non-natural a speech signal sounds. For example, some types of
non-natural speech signals could be such which sound robotic,
metallic or muffled.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Listening effort</em> refers to the effort a listener needs to use a
telecommunications system, and it should be minimized. Effort can be
both due to properties of the user-interface, but importantly also,
the listener might have to exert effort to understand a distorted
speech signal.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Annoyance</em> is closely related to listening effort, in that a signal
which is intelligible can have so severe distortions, noisiness or
transmission delays that it is really annoying. Usually annoyance
thus also increase listening effort.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Perception of distance</em> is the a feeling that the participant has
of the distance between participants. The main contributor to the
perception of distance is probably room acoustics, such that if the
distance between speaker and microphone is large, than the listener
feels distant to the speaker. It affects for example the intimacy of
a discussion, such that it is hard to feel intimate if the distance
is large.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It is clear that different types of quality are prominent at different
levels of coding-accuracy, which in turn is a function of available
bitrate (bandwidth). As a rough characterization, with current
technology, the quality-issues we optimize at different bitrates are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>At extremely low bitrates (below 1kbp/s), we cannot hope to encode
speech at high quality. At best, we can hope to retain
<em>intelligibility</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>At very low bitrates (1-2 kbp/s), intelligibility can usually be
preserved, but speech signals can still be distorted and noisy, such
that we want to minimize <em>listening effort</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>At low rates (3-8 kbps/s), we often have to balance between avoiding
noisyness, distortions, annoyance and naturalness. In other words,
we can often reduce noisyness by making the signal more muffled, but
that would reduce naturalness. It is then very much a question of
individual taste to choose which balance of distortions is best.</p></li>
<li><p>At medium rates (8-16 kbp/s), speech signals can already be coded
with a high quality such that we can try to minimize the number of
audible (perceivable) distortions. At these rates telecommunication
systems can often, in practice, be transparent in the sense that
users are not actively aware of any distortions, even if they would
clearly notice distortions in a comparison with the original signal.</p></li>
<li><p>At high rates (above 16 kbp/s), it should in general be possible to
encode speech signals at a perceptual transparent level. However, if
computational resources are limited and in applications which
require extremely low delay, distortions can still be audible.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Performance of a codec is however always a compromise between quality
and resources. By increasing the amount of computational resources (or
bandwidth) we can improve quality ad infinitum. The most important
limited resources are</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Bandwidth, that is, the bit-rate at which we can transmit data. It
is limited by</p>
<ul>
<li><p>physical constraints such as available radio channels,</p></li>
<li><p>power consumption (battery, ecology and price) and</p></li>
<li><p>infrastructure capacity (investment, complexity, power).</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>CPU, that is, the amount of operations per second that can be
performed, which is further limited by</p>
<ul>
<li><p>investment cost and</p></li>
<li><p>power consumption (battery, ecology and price).</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Memory, that is, the amount of RAM and ROM which is needed for the
system, which are limited by</p>
<ul>
<li><p>investment cost and</p></li>
<li><p>power consumption (battery, ecology and price).</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, the use-case of the intended speech (and audio) codec has
many important effects on the overall design. For example, the systems
configuration can be one of the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><em>One-to-one</em>; the classic telephony conversation, where two phones
transmit speech between them.</p></li>
<li><p><em>One-to-many</em>; could be applicable for example in a setting like a
radio-broadcast or in a storage application, where we encode once
and have potentially multiple receivers/decoders. Since there are
many receivers, we would then prefer that decoding the signal does
not require much resources. In practice that means that the sender
side (encoder) can use proportionally more resources.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Many-to-many;</em> the typical teleconferencing application, often
implemented with a cloud-server, such that merging of individual
speakers can be done centrally, such that bandwidth to the many
receivers can be saved.</p></li>
<li><p>*Many-to-one; *could be a distributed sensor-array scenario, where
multiple devices in a room jointly record speech. Since we then have
many encoders, they should be very simple and a majority of the
intelligence and computational resources should be at the receiver
end.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The overall design is also influenced by the type of transmission link.
In particular, the first few generations of digital mobile phones
operated with
<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_switching">circuited-switched</a>
networks, where a fixed amount of bandwidth is allocated to every
connection. Newer networks are however based on
<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_switching">packet-switched</a>
designs, where data is transmitted essentially over the internet and
capacity and routing is optimized on the fly. Packet-switched networks
can in practice be much better optimized for overall cost and
performance. However, a packet-switched network cannot guarantee a
steady flow of packets, such that the receiver has to tolerate both
delayed or missing packets as well as packets which arrive in the wrong
order. Clearly this has an impact on both overall transmission delay of
the system, as well as increases the computational complexity of the
receiver. The costs are however usually balanced by the savings gained
in network optimization.</p>
<p>A further important related aspect are assumptions about lost packets in
general. In many storage and broadcast applications we can assume that
packets are not lost and that all data is available at the receiver. It
however much more common that we must assume that some packets are lost.
Among the most important consequences of lost packets for the design is
that in decoding the signal, we cannot assume that we have access to
previous packets. Specifically, if decoding of the current packet
depends on the previous packet, then a single lost packet would make us
unable to decode any of the following packets. Clearly such sensitivity
to lost packets is unacceptable in most real-world transmission systems.
However, we could encode speech with much higher efficiency, if we were
allowed to use previous packets to predict the current packet. The
likelihood of lost packets thus dictates the compromise between
sensitivity to lost packets and coding (compression) efficiency.</p>
