<h1><span class="section-number">6.4. </span>Analysis of evaluation results<a class="headerlink" href="#analysis-of-evaluation-results" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>To determine the quality and performance of speech processing methods,
we often use <a class="reference internal" href="Subjective_quality_evaluation.html"><span class="doc std std-doc">subjective</span></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="Objective_quality_evaluation.html"><span class="doc std std-doc">objective
evaluation</span></a> methods. These methods however
give an array of results, one result for each sound sample for objective
methods, and in the case of subjective listening tests, one result for
each sounds sample per listener. Invariably, the results are noisy in
the sense that each sound sample and each listener will give a different
result. How do we then determine whether one method is better than the
other? In short, we have to perform statistical analysis of results. The
types of question we can answer with statistical analysis include:
“Based on measurement results, which result is most probable, that A is
better than B, that B is better than A, or is it impossible to
determine?”</p>
<div class="section" id="informal-analysis">
<h2><span class="section-number">6.4.1. </span>Informal analysis<a class="headerlink" href="#informal-analysis" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In practical laboratory work, after an experiment, you would always like
to get a first impression of the results as quickly as possible. With
informal analysis, we here refer to quick-and-dirty evaluation of data
to determine whether there it is worth investing time in a more formal
analysis. That is, if we already in the informal analysis determine that
our new method is not really better than past methods, then it more
productive to improve the method rather than perform a detailed analysis
of results. On the other hand, a detailed analysis can sometimes reveal
effects which are not visible in informal analysis and which could be
used to improve the method in question. In any case, when reporting
results (in a publication or even just to your superior), informal
analysis should never replace properly applied statistical tests.
Informal tests just given an indication of how much work will be
required for proper tests.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">6.4.1.1. </span>Example 1<a class="headerlink" href="#example-1" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Suppose we want to compare methods A and B, and we have already applied
PESQ on the outputs of both methods for 100 speech samples. How do we
know if A is better than B?</p>
<p><strong>First idea:</strong> Calculate the mean and standard deviation of both
measurements. Which method has a higher (better) mean? Is the standard
deviation clearly smaller than the difference in means?</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Suppose the mean of PESQ scores for A and B are 4.5 and 3.1, and
their corresponding standard deviations are 0.2 and 0.15. Clearly A
has a higher (better) PESQ score than B. The standard deviations are
small which indicates that the measurement rarely diverge far from
the mean. <em>This is the best case scenario</em> but unfortunately it
happens rarely in practice.</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose the mean of PESQ scores for A and B are 3.5 and 3.1, and
their corresponding standard deviations are 0.2 and 0.15.  Clearly
<em>the mean</em> PESQ score is higher (better) for A than B. In this case
it is however not immediately clear whether we can draw any definite
conclusions. Is the difference significant? The standard deviations
are not much smaller than the difference between the means,
indicating that sometimes A could be worse than B! <em>Further analysis
is required.</em></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that here we have chosen to discuss the <em>standard deviations</em>,
although we could equivalently present the <em>variances</em> of measurements.
The benefit of the standard deviation is that it is expressed in the
same units as the mean, such that we can directly get an intuitive
impression of the magnitude of the differences in means in comparison to
the standard deviations.</p>

<h4><span class="section-number">6.4.1.2.1. </span>Histograms<a class="headerlink" href="#histograms" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>By plotting the histograms of two measurements, we can study the
distribution of measurements.  For example in Histogram 1 on the right,
we can see two distributions (blue and green), whose means are 2.8 and
2.2. We can clearly see that the means of the sample are different, but
it is not immediately clear whether that is just a random coincidence or
if this is statistically significant. In Histogram 2 on the right, we
see a much clearer difference. Though the means are the same, 2.8 and
2.2, the standard deviations are now smaller 0.25 instead of 1.0, such
that we can be fairly confident that the difference in means is
<a class="reference external" href="http://significant.In">significant.In</a> Histogram 3, there is not doubt left, the distributions
are not overlapping and a statistical test would for sure show a
significant difference.</p>
<p>If we then compare histograms 2 and 4, we see that they have the same
means and standard deviations. However, while from histogram 2 we might
not be entirely certain that the difference is significant, in histogram
4 the amount of overlap is much reduced because the distributions are
skewed. Therefore already in informal analysis, we can be rather
confident that there is a significant difference in distributions. This
example thus demonstrates that the histograms can reveal properties of
the measurements which cannot be captured by the mean and standard
deviation.</p>
<p>A further example which demonstrates how some differences are not
captured by the mean and standard deviation is illustrated in Histogram
5. Here both measurements have the same mean, which could give the
impression that both measurements are “the same”. However, by looking at
the histogram, we find that the blue curve actually has two peaks, one
clearly lower and another higher than the green curve. Further analysis
is thus needed to determine the cause for the strange distribution.
Typically, for example, some methods behave differently for different
inputs. A speech enhancement method could be for example be effective
for voiced sounds, but fail for unvoiced sounds, such that the output
SNR has two peaks corresponding to respective classes of sounds.</p>
<p>These two last examples, Histograms 4 and 5, illustrate why it is in
general important to test whether evaluation results follow a Gaussian
(normal) distribution. Analysis of approximately Gaussian results is
less complicated then the analysis of skewed and multi-modal
distributions. However, applying methods which assume Gaussian
distributions on data which does not follow Gaussian distributions will
<em>often lead to incorrect conclusions</em>.</p>

<h4><span class="section-number">6.4.1.2.2. </span>Scatter plots<a class="headerlink" href="#scatter-plots" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>A useful tool for determining whether there are in hidden structures
between the results of two methods is to plot a scatter plot of the
results, where we plot dots (or other symbols) in a graph whose x- and
y- axis correspond to the evaluation results of two methods. Scatter
plots 1-3 on the right illustrate different typical scenarios. Plot 1
shows measurements in a circular area, indicating that the measurements
are uncorrelated. In speech and audio experiments this is highly
unusual. Scatter plot 2 is much more common, where measurements form a
tight band. This means that measurements are correlated. For example, in
a speech coding scenario, it could be that some speech samples are easy
to encode with high quality, such that methods A and B both give high
scores. Our objective is however to determine whether A or B is better,
and therefore we want to cancel out the effect of these correlations. We
can then take the difference between A and B to get the relative quality
of the two methods (see histogram on the right).</p>
<p>Another typical scenario is illustrated in Scatter plot 3, where the
scatter plot seems to form two distinctive groups. This would indicate
that there are some underlying categories in the data (such as
male/female, voiced/unvoiced, speech/silence) where performance is
different. Typically we would then like to find out what the categories
to determine if we can improve performance based on that information.
For example, if performance is bad for unvoiced sounds, we could have a
detector for unvoiced sounds, and perform different processing for such
sounds. See also section “Parallel plots” below.</p>
<p>Scatter plot 1: Two uncorrelated measurements A and B.</p>
<p><img alt="scatter1.png" src="../_images/155473529.png" /></p>
<p>Scatter plot 3: Two somewhat separate groups with different means and
correlations.</p>
<p><img alt="scatter3.png" src="../_images/155473532.png" /></p>
<p>Scatter plot 2 illustrating two measurements with slightly differing
means but high correlation (measurements form a tight group). In such a
case, the difference between the two measurements can often be very
informative, illustrated in the histogram below. We see that the mean
difference is 0.6 with a standard deviation of 0.21 and that the
distribution is clearly separated from 0 (=clearly separated from the
null-hypothesis “no difference between A and B”).</p>

<div class="section" id="box-plots">
<h4><span class="section-number">6.4.1.2.3. </span>Box plots<a class="headerlink" href="#box-plots" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>For comparison of distributions of several different measurements, we
often use box-plots (see Figure on the right). Here we have the sound
samples on x-axis (here called “Items”) and the improvement in POLQA
scores on the y-axis (for more about delta scores, see section “Delta”
below). The red line in the midle represent the median of all scores,
the blue box contains 50% of all measurements and the black horizontal
lines indicate the largest and lowest scores. In other words, each
quartile which contains 25% of measurements, is indicated by an
interval. An exception are <em>outliers</em>, that is, those measurements which
are deemed <em>exceptional</em> in some sense, are marked with red plus-signs.
Note that the choice of outliers is an sensitive issue; you cannot just
choose which values are exceptional, but have to apply formal methods
(it is an advanced topic which is not discussed here).</p>
<p>Note that box-plots are visualization methods and cannot be used alone
to make conclusions about statistical significance. Instead, they
valuable for descriptive analysis of results. For example in the figure
on the right, female and male speakers are the three items on the left
and right, respectively. Clearly we get an impression that the delta
scores of the female speakers are higher than those of male speakers.
However, the distributions are overlapping to such an extent that we
would need proper statistical analysis to determine how likely it is
that this is not just a coincidence.</p>
<p>In any case, box plots are useful in illustration of for example MUSHRA,
POLQA and PESQ scores as well as their delta scores. Box plots contain
less information than the corresponding histograms, but that omission
reduces clutter; We can easily display 20 items side by side with a
box-plot, whereas histograms of 20 items would be a mess.</p>

<p>A <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confusion_matrix">confusion matrix</a> is
the equivalent of a scatter plot for categorical data, often either
expressed in a table format or visualized as the as a heat-map. For
example, suppose you have a classifier whose objective is to classify
between speech, music and background noise. For each testing sample, you
then have the target output and the actual output of your classifier,
which you can write as a matrix such as:</p>
<table class="colwidths-auto table">
<thead>
<tr class="row-odd"><th class="head"><p></p></th>
<th class="head"><p>Actual music</p></th>
<th class="head"><p>Actual speech</p></th>
<th class="head"><p>Actual noise</p></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="row-even"><td><p><em>Predicted music</em></p></td>
<td><p>78</p></td>
<td><p>2</p></td>
<td><p>13</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>*Predicted speech</p></td>
<td><p>3</p></td>
<td><p>77</p></td>
<td><p>5</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td><p><em>Predicted noise</em></p></td>
<td><p>22</p></td>
<td><p>18</p></td>
<td><p>83</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Often the largest value in each column is identified by bold-face. In
this toy example, all classes are usually predicted correctly, which
means that for each actual label, the most often predicted label matches
the actual label. That is, music is most often classified as music (78
times), but also quite often as noise (22 times). Similarly, speech is
classified most often as speech (77 times) but also often as noise (18
times). Noise, on the other hand, is rarely classified as speech (5
times) and almost always correctly as noise (83 times).</p>
<p>If the number of labels is large, then it is often useful to plot the
matrix as a heat-map.</p>

<p>Suppose we want to compare methods A and B, and we have already
calculated the frame-wise SNR on the outputs of both methods for a range
of speech samples. We have also already calculated means and standard
deviations and plotted histograms and scatter plots. The only we have
found that there seems to be distinct categories of results indicated by
a bimodal or multi-modal (multipeak) distribution of SNRs.</p>
<p>How do we know if A is better than B? How does behaviour of A differ
from B? How do we characterize the differences between A and B?</p>
<p><strong>First idea:</strong> In the previous example we already demonstrated the
usefulness of illustrations. One of the all-time favourite illustrations
is to plot the original sound signal (or its spectrogram) side-by-side
with the frame-by-frame measurement results.</p>

<h4><span class="section-number">6.4.1.4.1. </span>Parallel plots<a class="headerlink" href="#parallel-plots" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>When doing frame-by-frame measurements such as SNR, we can plot results
over time to see whether there are any particular structures in the
results. Typically, for example, it could be that the SNR is high for
some continuous sections and poor somewhere else. Such cases could be
for example voiced and unvoiced sounds, where the speech processing
method behaves differently. However, to determine which regions
correspond to which types of speech, we can plot the waveform (or
spectrogram) in parallel with the SNR.</p>
<p>As an example, consider the output of a trivial <span class="xref myst">voice activity detector
(VAD)</span> illustrated on the right. The
top-pane contains the original waveform, the second pane signal energy
and the third pane the thresholded energy as VAD output. We can
immediately see that the VAD output is correct when signal energy is
high. However, in low-energy parts of the speech signal, VAD output
oscillates between speech and non-speech, even if it would make sense
that the whole segment (between 1.1 and 2.7s) would be labelled speech.
In the fourth pane, we see a comparison of the raw/original, desired and
post-processed output methods (the results are shifted vertically for
better clarity).</p>
<p>In this way, parallel plots are very good for illustrating and
characterizing performance of a system. We can easily relate properties
of the speech signal with the outputs, such that we can describe which
types of inputs give which types of outputs.</p>

<p>People are often unable to accurately grade absolute quality, even if
they can grade relative quality very accurately. That is, for example,
in a MUSHRA test, it is perfectly normal that three subjects would grade
two methods A and B such that:</p>
<table class="colwidths-auto table">
<thead>
<tr class="row-odd"><th class="head"><p></p></th>
<th class="head"><p></p></th>
<th class="head"><p></p></th>

<tbody>
<tr class="row-even"><td><p>Subject</p></td>
<td><p>Grade for A</p></td>
<td><p>Grade for B</p></td>

<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>1</p></td>
<td><p>35</p></td>

</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>Std</p></td>
<td><p>8.0</p></td>
<td><p>10.0</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>In other words, if we look at the absolute mean value and its standard
deviation, we find that B has a higher mean, but by only a tiny amount
in comparison to the standard deviation. However, closer inspection
reveals that the score of B is <em>always</em> higher than that of A. Every
subject thought that B is better than A!</p>
<p>Thus if we calculate the difference in scores between A and B, perhaps
that would give us a more conclusive answer.</p>
<table class="colwidths-auto table">
<thead>
<tr class="row-odd"><th class="head"><p>Subject</p></th>

<p>Clearly we now see that the difference A-B has a mean value of 4 and the
standard deviation is only 2. By collecting more listeners, then it
could be possible that this is significant difference between A and B.</p>
<p>The same approach can be applied also to other tests. For example, PESQ
scores for two methods A and B can vary a lot between speech samples,
but often the difference PESQ(A)-PESQ(B) can be much more consistent.</p>
<p>A formal way to check whether it is reasonable to use delta-values would
be a correlation test (see below).</p>

<p><strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong> If you have not already, <em>you should</em> take a course in

<h3><span class="section-number">6.4.2.1. </span>Student’s t-test<a class="headerlink" href="#student-s-t-test" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>When we want to determine if two normally distributed sets of values
have the same mean, we use <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-test">Student’s
t-test</a>. To be
applicable, it is critical that the sets really do follow the Gaussian
distribution (see “Normality tests” below). The t-test is intended for
small data-sets, usually with less than 30 data-points and it is not
meaningful for larger sets. Typical applications in speech and audio
are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Suppose we have made a MUSHRA-test, where we want to compare weather
a new method B is better than the old method A. The mean of B is
better (higher) than that of A, but how do we know if the result is
statistically significant? First of all, we need to check that
measurements follow the Gaussian distribution (see “Normality tests”
below). If distributions are indeed Gaussian, we can apply the
t-test. Given a threshold for significance (say 5%), the t-test
gives an answer; either H=0, the difference between A and B is not
significant or, H=1, that B is better than A.</p></li>
<li><p>Similarly, we can calculate the difference between A and B, and if
the distribution is Gaussian, we can determine whether the
difference to zero is statistically significant.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If the data sets are not normally distributed, it is often possible to
use the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mann%E2%80%93Whitney_U_test">Wilcoxon rank-sum
test</a> or the
<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilcoxon_signed-rank_test">Wilcoxon signed-rank

<p>Many statistical tests are only applicable when the input signal follows
a Gaussian distribution. To test whether a distribution indeed is
Gaussian, we use a <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normality_test">normality
test</a>. The <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapiro%E2%80%93Wilk_test">Shapiro-Wilk

particular test of normality, which is particularly reliable. The output
of normality tests is that, given a particular level of confidence (such
as 5%), the given data set is Gaussian.</p>

<p>When comparing multiple data sets at the same time, <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_variance">analysis of
variance</a> (ANOVA)
can be interpreted as a generalization of the t-test. It tries to
explain phenomenons in the data by assigning them to different sources
of variation. Say if we observe differences between methods A and B, but
know that some listeners have taken the test in the morning and others
in the evening, we can analyse whether the difference is due to the the
time of day or due to inherent differences in A and B.</p>
<p>Again it is important to observe the assumptions of this test; namely,
the classical version of ANOVA assumes that prediction errors are
normal, that measurements are independent and the assigned groups of
data have uniform statistics.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">6.4.2.4. </span>Correlation tests<a class="headerlink" href="#correlation-tests" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Often two data sets are correlated. For example, if we analyse the
fundamental frequency and intensity of a speech signal, we probably find
that shouted speech has a high intensity and fundamental frequency,
whereas silent speech has low intensity and a low fundamental. To check
whether two data sets indeed have a meaningful correlation, we use
correlation tests. The two most common correlation tests are</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_correlation_coefficient">Pearson correlation
coefficient</a>
(PCC), which essentially fits a linear regression line through the
data, such that we can then use the t-test to determine whether the
thus-explained data is significantly different from the original. In
other words, the Pearson correlation coefficient assumes a linear
correlation between variables.</p></li>
