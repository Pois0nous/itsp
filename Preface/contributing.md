## Contributing

We welcome all types of useful contributions! See also our [code of conduct](content:codeofconduct).

Content contributors will, unless author requests to remain anonymous, be automatically included on the [list of authors](content:authors) and for bugfixers we will create an "also featuring" list. 
The best way of contributing however depends on type of contribution:

- For small bugfixes
   - Post an [issue on github.com](https://github.com/Speech-Interaction-Technology-Aalto-U/itsp/issues), or    
   - Modify the code directly and push a [pull request](https://github.com/Speech-Interaction-Technology-Aalto-U/itsp/pulls).
- For clearly missing or incomplete content
   - Create the content and push a [pull request](https://github.com/Speech-Interaction-Technology-Aalto-U/itsp/pulls). 
- Extensions of topic area
   - Discuss it first with the other authors by posting an [issue on github.com](https://github.com/Speech-Interaction-Technology-Aalto-U/itsp/issues).

The source material is stored at [https://github.com/Speech-Interaction-Technology-Aalto-U/itsp](https://github.com/Speech-Interaction-Technology-Aalto-U/itsp).
